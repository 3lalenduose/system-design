Some of the critics' quotes are as follows:
 
- \"Yeon Sang-hoâs âTrain to Busanâ is the most purely entertaining zombie film in some time, finding echoes of George Romeroâs and Danny Boyleâs work, but delivering something unique for an era in which kindness to others seems more essential than ever.\" - Brian Tallerico, Roger Ebert [^3^]
- \"For almost 45 minutes, Yeon Sang-hoâs Train to Busan is on pace to become the best, most urgent zombie movie since â28 Days Later.â And then â at once both figuratively and literally â this broad Korean blockbuster derails in slow-motion, sliding off the tracks and bursting into a hot mess of generic moments and digital fire.\" - David Ehrlich, IndieWire [^4^]
- \"Writer-director Yeon Sang-hoâs Train to Busan, which largely takes place aboard a high-seed KTX train traveling from Seoul to Busan in the midst of a zombie outreak, is so nakedly hospitable to conservative attitudes that one may come to resent its strikingly creative and efficiently orchestrated maximalist frights.\" - Ed Gonzalez, Slant Magazine
