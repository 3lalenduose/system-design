If you are using Microsoft Office 2007 and want to change the language on the ribbon and commands for some applications, you may need to download and install a language pack. A language pack is a collection of files and resources that enable you to use Office in a different language.
  
One of the languages that you can choose is Romanian, which is spoken by about 24 million people in Romania and Moldova. With the Romanian language pack, you can use Office applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Access in Romanian.
