# Karl Gustav Jung: A Pioneer of Depth Psychology
 
Karl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist who founded analytical psychology. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, especially in the fields of psychology, philosophy, religion, and literature. Jung explored the unconscious mind, the collective unconscious, archetypes, symbols, dreams, synchronicity, and the psychological aspects of alchemy, mythology, and spirituality.
 
One of Jung's main contributions to psychology was his typology of personality, which distinguishes between introversion and extraversion, and four psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. He also developed the concepts of the persona, the shadow, the anima and animus, the self, and individuation. Jung believed that these elements constitute the structure of the psyche and that by becoming aware of them and integrating them into a harmonious whole, one can achieve psychological growth and wholeness.
