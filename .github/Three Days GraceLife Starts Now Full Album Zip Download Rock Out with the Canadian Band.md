Life Starts Now is the third studio album by Three Days Grace, released on September 22, 2009. The album was produced by Howard Benson, who also worked with the band on their previous album, One-X.

The album contains 12 tracks, with a total length of 43 minutes and 34 seconds. The album spawned four singles: "Break", "The Good Life", "World So Cold", and "Lost in You". The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the band's musicianship and energy, but criticized the album's lack of originality and innovation.
